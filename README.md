## Learnings :brain:

AngularJS is an open source, JavaScript framework developed by Google and used to create SPA (Single Page Applications) and extend HTML with powerfull features, uses HTML's syntax to express the application's components clearly. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, wich helps to separate business logic, data presentation and user interaction. Angular and JavaScript bring structure and consistency to web application development, and provides scalability and maintainability. Features of Angular:

- Document Object Model (DOM): Treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document. Angular uses regular DOM. This will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the data to be updated.
- TypeScript: Angular is written in TypeScript. It's a superset of JavaScript and offers excellent consistency for the code, improves reliability and maintainability of the application. It introduces type checking of variables, function parameters and return values, this helps catch potential errors during development and code navigation.
- Data biniding: Allows an internet user to manipulate Web page elements using a Web browser. It's used for web pages that contain interactive components such as forms, calculator, tutorials and games. Angular uses two-way data binding, one of the most important features, it's simpolifies the development process by elimintating the UI and the data model. It allows for a more declarative and reactive approach, where changes are automatically propagated in both directions. This powerful feature enchances productivity and helps keep the UI and data model in sync, resulting in a more seamless and interactive user exeperience in Angular applications
- Testing
